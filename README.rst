Minesweeper clone. For when you watch something too boring.

Bring up with ctrl+x, then move with the cursor keys, and use space to
uncover tiles, or b to flag them.

Bugs: weird scaling issues, especially if the window aspect ratio is
      not 16:9. Uses undocumented/private API and might thus break
      any time.
